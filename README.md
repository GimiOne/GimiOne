## Hi there 👋

I'm Dmitry. I'm studying to be a ML developer.

I have a higher education in the direction of “Informatics and Computer Science”
And I have a certificate in the basics of Python, and a lot of courses on YouTube:
https://stepik.org/cert/1218320  
I've read a couple books on computer design. For example, “Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software” by Charles Petzold and “Computer Architecture” by Tanenbaum, good and informative books for different levels of depth. But mostly I read different articles instead of books.

I worked on an Open Source project Fuflomycin that helps people to identify drugs without an evidence-based medical base. Aggregates 3 sources of information and based on it works a web application to find blacklisted drugs.  
Github repository: https://github.com/fuflomycin/web  
Finished web application: https://fuflomycin.github.io/web

When I worked in tech support of an internet service provider I wrote a small one-page web application that counted the amount of daily payments for a service, as well as the end date of that service. In this project I realized how important it is to use the Decimal data type and not any other)

My other small projects just for fun:  
Spirograph: https://gimione.github.io/spiro/index.html  
Movie Search: https://gimione.github.io/sm/index.html  
Deep watch: https://gimione.github.io/deepClock/index.html

There are more, but I don't want to show their old code 😄
